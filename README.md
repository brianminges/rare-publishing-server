# Rare Publishing: It's sorta like Facebook

## General information
This is a group full stack project (React, Django) as part of a software development bootcamp at Nashville Software School. Other contributors were [madison-hepner](https://github.com/madison-hepner), [snagle33](https://github.com/snagel33) and [kylebuckner88](https://github.com/kylebuckner88). My contributions were creating posts; displaying posts based on subscriptions, all posts and user posts; post submission form; all comment functionality; filtering for user and title search; all design and css.
